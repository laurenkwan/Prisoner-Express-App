# Personal Reference: Instructions
Use generative AI to generate examples.
Use generate AI to try and help you solve problems while working on this assignment.
Critically evaluate generated solutions before using them, especially against the Vue and Bootstrap Vue Next documentation.
Document all the prompts you used and each generated response in a file called references.md at the root of your repository.
Submit your own work.
Don’t just submit the generated “solutions” as your own. Generative AI is best used as a reference or an example.
Use the generated solutions to write your own solution.
Your code should use the methods and approaches presented in this class.
Your code should look like the solutions posted to Canvas for previous exercises. (If it doesn’t, then you probably didn’t use the methods and approaches presented in this class.)
